This is just a template for a timer used in C++.

It allows you to time a function call to about 4 decimal places using wall-time and about 2 decimal places using cpu time.

To use, after cloning and entering the root directory, issue the following command:

> mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j3;

> ./timeit

It will output to the terminal the amount of time it took...
